# EDB Notes: Engineering Decision Behavior in Software Development

This repository contains **engineering-oriented notes, explanations, and worked examples**
about how **decision behavior forms during software development**, especially in
AI-assisted and automation-heavy environments.

It focuses on *how engineers think, decide, and constrain change* —
before those decisions become code, pipelines, or systems.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a **thinking layer** for software engineering.

It exists to:
- Explain how **decision behavior emerges** in modern development workflows
- Make implicit assumptions and decision paths **visible**
- Explore structural phenomena such as:
  - Inference Creep
  - Decision Vacancy
  - Scope Drift
- Clarify how constraints, specifications, and directives shape outcomes
- Provide reasoning context for frameworks, papers, and tools built elsewhere

This is where ideas are **understood**, not finalized.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository is **not**:
- ❌ A research paper archive (see `papers`)
- ❌ A standards or compliance repository
- ❌ A schema or implementation repo
- ❌ A product specification

Governance appears here **only insofar as it emerges from engineering behavior**,
not as a primary framing.

## Why Decision Behavior Matters in Software Engineering

In traditional software development, decisions were:
- localized
- human-paced
- reversible

In AI-assisted and factory-style development, decisions are:
- distributed across tools and agents
- formed before execution
- difficult to reverse once embedded

Understanding *how decisions form* is therefore a **software engineering problem**
before it becomes a governance problem.

This repository treats decision behavior as:
- an engineering phenomenon
- a design-time concern
- something that can be shaped, anchored, or left to drift

## How to Use This Repository

You can read this repository in multiple ways:

### By Topic
Concept-oriented exploration of ideas such as:
- Decision Behavior
- Inference Creep
- Anchoring
- Scope and Boundary

### By Series
Progressive or narrative explorations, including:
- Worked examples
- Failure reconstructions
- Design thought experiments

### By Platform
Notes adapted from or related to:
- LinkedIn
- Medium
- Substack

Each platform may emphasize different aspects,
but the underlying reasoning remains consistent.

## Relationship to Other Repositories

This repository is part of a broader ecosystem:

| Repository             | Role                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `papers`               | Formal research manuscripts and preprints  |
| `schemas` / `artifact` | Structured, operational representations    |
| `edb-notes`            | Conceptual reasoning and explanation layer |

Ideas often appear here **before** they are formalized elsewhere.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is written for:
- Software engineers
- System architects
- Developers working with AI-assisted tooling
- Anyone interested in how development decisions actually form

No governance background is required.
Engineering intuition comes first.

## Where to Start

If this is your first time here:
- Start with a worked example or series
- Or browse by topic to get a conceptual overview

Understanding precedes frameworks.
